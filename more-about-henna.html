            <p>Henna’s symbolism extends beyond beauty and decoration, serving as an important element in cultural rituals and ceremonies. In Indian weddings, for example, the bride’s hands and feet are adorned with elaborate henna patterns, often including hidden initials or symbols related to the couple. The practice is more than ornamental—henna is believed to bring good fortune, happiness, and protect against the "evil eye." The richness of the stain is also said to represent the strength of love between the couple, with darker stains traditionally associated with stronger bonds.

                In addition to weddings, henna is used during festivals such as Eid, Diwali, and Karva Chauth. These celebrations often include family gatherings where henna is applied, symbolizing joy and unity. In Moroccan and Middle Eastern traditions, henna is also used for protection during life-changing events such as childbirth and religious festivals.
                
                Henna designs vary by region, with Indian patterns typically involving detailed, swirling motifs, while Arabic designs focus on floral, flowing patterns that are often more spaced out. African henna designs tend to be bold and geometric. This diversity of styles reflects the versatility of henna as both a cultural and artistic expression. Today, henna is embraced globally, blending ancient traditions with modern fashion and self-expression.</p>
